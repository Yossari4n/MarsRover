### Mars Rover
Mars rover is a simplistic, physics based simualation of a rover called Oppurtunity. Simulation used Bullet Physics library to simulate vehicle. the terrain the rover moves on is procedurally generated using a Perlin Noise algorithm. The graphic is being rendered with modern OpenGL. Project was created with my own game engine utilizing Component Based System paradigm.
